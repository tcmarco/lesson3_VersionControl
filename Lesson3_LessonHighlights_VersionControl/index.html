            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a software developed to manage different version or to registry all modifications in a file or a set of files. It is very useful for individual developers or a team of developers. The most obvious benefit of using version control is the ability to have an unlimited number of people working on the same code base, without having to constantly send files among team members. There are several version control system but the "GIT" seems to be the more popular. Initially developed by the creator of the Linux kernel Linus Torvalds, Git has recently been developed by the Web community. If there is no version system, imagine the chaos between two people opening the same file at the same time. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The GitHub is a web service that offers several extra features applied to git. GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project. In short, you can use free github to host personal projects. In addition, almost all projects / frameworks / open source development libraries are on github, and you can follow them through new versions, reporting bugs or contribute even sending code and corrections. The main features of github are: integrated issue tracker, collaborative code review, easily manage team within organizations, simple sharing code, data security, reliable support team, easier to publish a website, search for wiki pages from either the main search page, or within a repository, support to HTTPS.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">SSH is a secure way to remotely access other machines that provide this type of service. The old remote access services (telnet,ftp, ...) have serious safety problems, since all information is passed through the Internet as plain text. SSH uses a powerful encryption method called Public Key Cryptography which provides authentication and encryption between the hosts (server and client) so that no password and sending no data is easily intercepted by others hosts.This method uses a public key for data encryption and a private key for decryption. So, before one PC connect to the one Mac, they go through a process of "recognition" of public key exchange: the PC sends its public key to the Mac recognizes it, and the Mac does the same with the PC. Made the exchange, communication can be safely made. Git uses the ssh method to protect data.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are a lot of commands to work with git some of them are more populars and others are less frequent. Here are the basic commands to start using Git:<p class="lead"><b>git add:</b> add all the files that were changed since the last backup to the staging area.</p>
            <p class="lead"><b>git commit -m:</b> commit the changes in the file to the local repository.</p>
            <p class="lead"><b>git push:</b> push the changes in the local repository to the remote repository.</p>
            <p class="lead"><b>git clone:</b> clone the files existing in a remote repository to a local repository.</p>
            <p class="lead"><b>git log:</b> show all the backups created in the repository</p>
            <p class="lead"><b>git status:</b> show the files that were changed since the last back up and which ones are already added to the staging.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Data Assurance</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The data model that Git uses ensures the cryptographic integrity of every bit the project. Every file and commit is checksummed and retrieved by its checksum when checked back out. It's impossible to get anything out of Git other than the exact bits put in. It is also impossible to change any file, date, commit message, or any other data in a Git repository without changing the IDs of everything after it. This means that if one has a commit ID, you can be assured not only that your project is exactly the same as when it was committed, but that nothing in its history was changed.

Most centralized version control systems provide no such integrity by default.</p>
